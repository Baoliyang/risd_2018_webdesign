              Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? <br>
              Then we wouldn't have to wait so long. <br>
             
              And wouldn't it be nice to live together. <br>
              In the kind of world where we belong. <br>
              You know it's gonna make it that much better.<br>
              When we can say goodnight and stay together.<br></p>

              Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up. <br>
              In the morning when the day is new? <br>
              And after having spent the day together. <br>
              Hold each other close the whole night through.<br>
              Happy times together we've been spending. <br>
              I wish that every kiss was never ending. <br>

          Wouldn't it be nice?<br>
          Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true. <br>
          Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do. <br>
          We could be married. <br>
          And then we'd be happy.<br>

          Wouldn't it be nice? <br>
          You know it seems the more we talk about it. <br>
          It only makes it worse to live without it.<br>
          But let's talk about it.<br>
